# Personal Project: Resume (Automatic-Layouting using React.js)

Hi all! I am creating a mini-project to sharpen my logic in creating an automatic layouting system. This project was actually dedicated to ordinary people who doesn't know programming, so that they can create a layout without coding. This mini project only shows a small hurdle in the long journey ahead. 


## Project Description

This program will generate a resume based on an input in JSON format, in which contains data to be shown and a few layout details. The data in _components/Data.js_ acts as a template and shown dynamically. The adjustment made are all either written at _Data.js_, or automatically set by the program. There's also a toggle on the upper-right corner of the website, in which the language of the website can be changed. Note that the layout could be different for each language added.
## Result

The result of this project is accessible at https://hk-resume.netlify.app/. Because of its static nature, it is easily deployed by using a platform such as netlify. 
## Improvement

One improvement is clear: Data could be editted using separate User Interface e.g. Dashboard and then uploaded to a database, so that the user can edit their inputs easily. Other advanced implementation is to add a drag and drop system, in which the boxes or containers can be resized by the user itself. 
## Afterword

As this is only a small project that shows the potential of automatic layouting, I hope that this project may help kickstart another creation and be helpful to people, who are having a problem with similar projects. Do note that the code written here may not be as efficient.
